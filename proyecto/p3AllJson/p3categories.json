      "content": "Smart contract platforms are usually blockchains that host smart contracts or decentralized applications. Users can interact with different smart contracts on these platforms to perform various actions such as lending and borrowing funds, staking their assets or minting NFTs.\r\n\r\nSmart contracts are programs that are stored on the blockchain and are automatically executed when certain conditions are met. To interact with these smart contracts, transaction fees may need to be paid and the amount and asset required will vary based on the platform’s architecture. Usually, the smart contract platform’s native token is used to pay for transaction fees. Some popular examples of smart contract platforms include Ethereum, Solana and Polygon.",

It was launched by Binance in September 2020 to host smart contracts and decentralized applications. Unlike Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work consensus model, BSC uses the Proof-of-Staked-Authority model which has allowed for low transaction fees and higher throughput. Compared to Ethereum which would usually cost hundreds to make a few transactions, BSC only charges less than a few dollars. BSC supports the BEP-20 token format, which is essentially the same format as ERC-20 but on a different chain, and transaction fees are paid in Binance’s native exchange token, BNB.",
